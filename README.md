# Chain-of-Thought Prompting Case Study

This case study compares baseline prompting, explicit chain-of-thought,
and controlled chain-of-thought techniques on the same explanatory task.

## Goal
Evaluate how different prompting strategies affect reasoning quality
and output controllability.

## Task
Explain why the platypus has its unusual combination of traits.

## What This Shows
- Impact of chain-of-thought prompting on reasoning clarity
- Separation of reasoning process from user-facing output
- Practical use of controlled CoT for production scenarios

## Repository Structure
- `prompts/` – baseline, explicit CoT, and controlled CoT prompts
- `results/` – real model outputs
- `evaluation.md` – observations and conclusions
